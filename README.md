# PyAlarm
## A Raspberry Pi-based security system.

## Purpose
This is a fun little project for managing and viewing the status of a MQTT-connected group of sensors. 
My intent is for this to monitor the MQTT feeds of the little IoT sensors I've built and placed around the house.
It should be general enough to handle most types of sensors. It should allow for multiple users with multiple "Locations",
which are collections of sensors.

## TODO
- Implement User creation.
- Implement Location creation/population.
- Implement MQTT connections.
- Implement Device creation, configuration, and management.
- Implement base device types.
  - ex: Keypad(Device)
- Implement FE
- Prepare Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml
